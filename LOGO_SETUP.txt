# Logo Setup Instructions

Your app now uses TWO separate logos:

## 1. App Icon Logo
**File:** `public/logo.png`
- **Used for:** App icon on home screen, browser tabs, shortcuts
- **Recommended size:** 512x512 pixels (minimum 192x192)
- **Format:** PNG with transparent background (or solid color)
- **Purpose:** This is what users see on their phone's home screen after installing the PWA

## 2. Splash Screen Logo
**File:** `public/splash-logo.png` (you need to add this)
- **Used for:** Splash screen that shows when app first launches
- **Recommended size:** 256x256 to 512x512 pixels
- **Format:** PNG (can have transparent background)
- **Purpose:** This appears for 2 seconds when users open your app from home screen

## How to Add Your Splash Logo

1. Create or prepare your splash screen logo (can be different from app icon)
2. Save it as `splash-logo.png` in the `public` folder
3. The app will automatically use it on the splash screen

**Note:** If `splash-logo.png` doesn't exist, the app will automatically fallback to using `logo.png` for the splash screen.

## Current Setup

✅ Splash screen shows on first app load
✅ Splash screen duration: 2 seconds
✅ Shows only once per session (won't show on page refreshes)
✅ Automatic fallback to logo.png if splash-logo.png is missing

## File Structure
```
public/
  ├── logo.png           ← App icon (already exists)
  └── splash-logo.png    ← Add this for splash screen
```

## Customization

To change splash screen duration or behavior, edit:
- **File:** `src/App.tsx`
- **Line:** `<SplashScreen onComplete={handleSplashComplete} minDuration={2000} />`
- Change `minDuration={2000}` to your preferred milliseconds (e.g., 3000 = 3 seconds)
